# DigitalRecipe

This Website was inspired by family made & crafted recipe books or collections. Growing up, recipes were passed down from generation to generation and written on an index card or sheet of paper. Nearly everyone in my family has their own version of this. As we move forward into a more digital age and we find more and more recipes online, we thought it would be a great idea to create a digital recipe book where you can add, edit, and delete recipes. This means that you can grab recipes from other websites, or input recipes you have already written down to have everything in one place. 

The user can add an image to represent their recipe as well as add any comments such as substitution they may want or need. We have created the UX/UI components to be clean and ordered with a clear usability path. 

We hope you enjoy interacting with this website! 

Best, 
Joe & Erik git
